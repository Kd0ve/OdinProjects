For rock, paper, scissors, open up Developer Tools and look at the console output. You can open the inspect element/dev tools by pressing the three buttons in the top right corner (if you're in chrome) and going down to "More Tools" where you will find at the bottom of the popout the dev tools. The output of points and winners will appear in the console there.
